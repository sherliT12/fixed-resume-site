      High Distinction
    </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Small team collaboration in an evidence-based project of designing for space missions for astronaut health and space architecture in habitat design. Explored new concepts and integrated own various skills (UI design, solid modelling in Solidworks and making scaled realistic models) to fulfil my theme of research – food preparation in moon-orbiting module. A complex, multi-focus research task that gave way to fast-paced decision making and critical reflective practices.

      <b>Design Thinking for Competitive Advantage</b><br>
      Credit
    </li>
    </ul>

Programmed an Arduino robot to draw a logo 3. Produced a cardboard “moving” bird-shaped lamp. Design Studio 2 involved a three-member group project to design a safety-oriented product for Surf Life Saving Australia.
